# Lamini LLM Fine-Tuning Project

**Lamini is a developer-friendly platform that enables fast, efficient fine-tuning and deployment of custom large language models using your own data on any hardware.**

## Overview

This project showcases how to fine-tune a **Large Language Model (LLM)** using the **Lamini** platform. The code provided creates a small sample dataset containing user questions and appropriate answers about Lamini itself, then uses that data to customize a pre-trained model.

## What This Project Does

* **Loads Example Data**: A list of question-and-answer pairs about Lamini is prepared to serve as training data.
* **Connects to Lamini's API**: The Lamini client is initialized using an API key to access their model services.
* **Selects a Pre-trained Model**: It uses the `Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct` model, which is a powerful instruction-tuned LLM.
* **Fine-Tunes the Model**: The selected model is trained on the sample dataset to improve its ability to respond to similar questions.

## What is Lamini?

**Lamini** is a platform designed to simplify working with large language models. It allows developers to:

* Tune LLMs on their own data.
* Optimize model performance using hyperparameters.
* Use models in Python scripts or web apps via APIs.
* Deploy models on cloud or enterprise infrastructure.


## Fine-Tuning Settings Used

In this project, a few important settings (hyperparameters) are specified for fine-tuning:

* **Learning Rate**: Controls how quickly the model updates during training.
* **Early Stopping** (optional): Stops training automatically when performance stops improving.
* **Max Steps** (optional): Limits how many training steps to perform.
* **Optimizer Type** (optional): Chooses the algorithm used to adjust weights during training (e.g., Adam or SGD).
